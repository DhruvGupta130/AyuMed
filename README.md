## Configuration Files 🔧

### `application.properties`

Define key settings for the database, server, and file handling in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Server Port
server.port=8080

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Hibernate Configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

file.storage.path= storage/patients

```

## Getting Started 🚀

To get your application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-opd-management.git
   ```

2. **Set up the Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `hospital_db`. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
    ```
   - Update your database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Below is an example of the database configuration:

   ```properties
   # Database Configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

   # Hibernate Configuration
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - To start the spring-application, you can use your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or run the following command in your terminal:
      ```bash
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
      ```

   - Make sure you have the correct version of Java installed (Java 23 or above is recommended). You can verify your Java version by running:
      ```bash
      java -version
     ```
   
   - To start the react-application, you can use your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or run the following command in your terminal:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

   - Make sure you have the correct version of Node.js installed. You can verify your Node.js version by running:
      ```bash
      npm --version
     ```

4. **Access the API Documentation**:
   - If you are using Springdoc OpenAPI or Swagger for API documentation, you can access it by navigating to the following URLs in your web browser:
      - [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) - A user-friendly interface to test the API endpoints.
      - [Swagger API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs) - View the API documentation in JSON format.
