## Project Structure üìÇ

- `src/main/java`: Contains core Java classes, including entities, services, controllers, and repositories
   - `entities/`: Java classes representing the database tables, such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment, and Billing
   - `services/`: Business logic and service layer classes
   - `controllers/`: REST API endpoints for handling requests
   - `repositories/`: Data access layer for interacting with the database
- `src/main/resources`: Stores application configuration files
   - `application.properties`: Configures database connections, server ports, and other settings
   - `data.sql`: Optional file for seeding initial data (patients, doctors, etc.) into the database
   - `schema.sql`: Optional file for defining database schemas, if not using JPA auto-configuration
- `src/test`: Contains test cases to ensure code reliability and quality


## Configuration Files üîß

### `application.properties`

Define key settings for the database, server, and file handling in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Server Port
server.port=8080

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

# Hibernate Configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

file.storage.path= storage/patients

```

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get your application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-opd-management.git
   ```

2. **Set up the Database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `hospital_db`. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
    ```
   - Update your database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Below is an example of the database configuration:

   ```properties
   # Database Configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

   # Hibernate Configuration
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - To start the application, you can use your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   - Make sure you have the correct version of Java installed (Java 11 or above is recommended). You can verify your Java version by running:
      ```bash
      java -version
     ```

4. **Access the API Documentation**:
   - If you are using Springdoc OpenAPI or Swagger for API documentation, you can access it by navigating to the following URLs in your web browser:
      - [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) - A user-friendly interface to test the API endpoints.
      - [Swagger API Documentation](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs) - View the API documentation in JSON format.

## Sample Excel File for Doctor Registration

To bulk register doctors in the system, use the following Excel format:
